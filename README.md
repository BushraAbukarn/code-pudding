## üìå Purpose
This project focuses on analyzing airline booking data to uncover key marketing drivers that influence revenue. The purpose was to explore how different factors ‚Äî such as flight type, booking behavior, geographic origin, household demographics, and upsell preferences ‚Äî impact sales performance.

## üìÑ Project Brief
This analysis provides valuable insights into airline booking trends and customer behavior, revealing critical levers for revenue optimization. Roundtrip bookings dominate in both volume and revenue, making them a strategic focus for promotions and upsell opportunities. Monday and Sunday emerge as the most active booking days, suggesting the best timing for targeted campaigns.
The Asia-Pacific region‚Äîincluding Australia, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, and China‚Äîdrives the majority of sales, confirming it as the most lucrative market. These countries also show high demand for upsell services. Additionally, single travelers and couples make up the largest household segments booking online, presenting clear profiles for segmentation.
To maximize profitability, airlines should prioritize digital marketing in South and East Asia, tailor service offerings by trip type and flight length, and enhance booking experiences through the most-used channels.

## üéØ Key Objectives
1. What marketing factors attribute to highest sales?
2. What routes generated the most purchase leads?
3. How flight durations affect purchase spendings?

## Recommendations

**Recommendations for marketing**:
1. Launch targeted bundled upgrade promotions for extra baggage, in-flight meals and preferred seating options for Australia and Malaysia since they contribute to the highest upgrades.
2. Consider mobile app discounts to draw more customers for bookings via mobile app since revenue is compared to internet sales channel
3.Monday and Sunday are the highest booking days therefore schedule email campaigns, social media promotions, and retargeting ads to launch on sundays and peak on mondays for customers to plan their trips in advance.
4. Single customers and couples contribute to the highest sales therefore design marketing campaigns specifically for these groups (solo travel deals, romantic getaways) plan for round trip flight prefence since this is the preferred option

**Recommendations for sales growth**:
1. Prioritize budget spending on the AKL-KUL route for round-trip segment via online channels to leverage its exceptional lead volume.
2. Launch targeted mobile app promotions for DMK-KIX and DPS-ICN routes to close the gap between internet and mobile acquisition.
3. Introduce loyalty incentives for lower volume routes like ICN-SIN to stimulate both web and mobile leads

**Recommendations for customer spendings**:
1. Enhance offerings for long and medium flights -such as improved meal options and seat upgrades.
